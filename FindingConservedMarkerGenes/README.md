This task aims to validate whether a given set of marker genes for a specific cell type can accurately classify cell types based on their expression using simple machine learning classifiers, such as decision tree classification. The primary goal is to determine if decision trees can effectively classify cell types across species, providing quantitative evidence that these marker genes are reliable. This analysis was conducted on scRNA-seq data from cross-species dorsal horn spinal cord and is part of a larger project in the Pfenning Lab that has been submitted for publication. The objective was to statistically validate the accuracy of the marker genes identified by the lab. I contributed to this analysis by implementing the classifier and visualizing decision boundaries to confirm that the marker genes were conserved for each cell type, thus validating the lab's findings.
